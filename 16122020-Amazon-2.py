# This problem was asked by Amazon.

# Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring 
# that contains at most k distinct characters.

# For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct
# characters is "bcb".

def longest_substring(s,k):
    # code go here currently I can only think of a quick O(n^2)
    return 0
