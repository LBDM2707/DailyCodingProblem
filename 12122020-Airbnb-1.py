# This problem was asked by Airbnb.

# Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of 
# non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

# For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. 
# [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

# Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?

# Version 1, O(N^2) with dynamic programing
