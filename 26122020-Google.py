# This problem was asked by Google.

# You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board. 
# Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you 
# can walk on.

# Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the 
# minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start. 
# If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, 
# and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of 
# the board.

# For example, given the following board:

# [[f, f, f, f],
# [t, t, f, t],
# [f, f, f, f],
# [f, f, f, f]]
# and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left), the minimum 
# number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go 
# through (1, 2) because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.
